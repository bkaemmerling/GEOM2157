# GEOM2157
Geospatial Programming - GEOM 2157

My project requires two input shape files (.shp). These consist of one point dataset, containing tree locations with associated DBH attribute of the tree and one polygon dataset containing the construction footprint of the project.

My script can be found in Project_4.py

Examples of these files for testing the script have been included.
